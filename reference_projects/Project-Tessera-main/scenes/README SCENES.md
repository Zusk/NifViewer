Scenes (and Nodes) are an integral part of Godot. Although it is possible to cram the entire game into a single scene, it is probably not helpful in maintaining a clean overview of what's going on.

I started creating scenes in numerical order of when those scenes are displayed from start of the game. I'm not sure if in the long run this is a practical way of doing things but at least it helps figuring out at a glance in what order things (should) happen.
