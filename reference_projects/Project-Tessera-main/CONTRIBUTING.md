Contributions are very welcome! 

Right now this project is only being developed by myself but I would love to add more people to it. I'm not a professional software developer but I firmly believe that putting effort into something is half the battle and who knows, once we've reached a certain point and a couple of dedicated people have come together we could have a serious chance of playing our beloved Civ4 in 64bit 3D glory!

I have one request to make though: please do not submit decompiled or proprietary material! Thank you so much!
